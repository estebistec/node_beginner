This is me, trying my first node code with the tutorial at
http://www.nodebeginner.org/.

I expanded on it a bit along the way, as you can see. Specifically, I:

* Played around with the request handlers, creating some generic handlers to:
  * render pages
  * do redirect responses
* Used mustache instead of strcat'ing the markup in the handlers
* Did some optional/defaulted function parameters in various places (that was weird)

Dependencies:

* formidable
* mu2
